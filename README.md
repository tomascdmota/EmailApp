# EmailApp

This project is a starter for an IT department that would need to create multiply emails for their colleagues without the hassle of doing so manually.

 This has a main method where you can give the name and surname of the new employee, and their department, and it gives you an email with a password (which they will have to change, preferably during the first login).
 I can add a database in the future, so it feels a lot more realistic, an API to interact with it using JDBC, maybe using SWING or JavaFX build an UI for it. A lot can be done here.
